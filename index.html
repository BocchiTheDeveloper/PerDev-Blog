            <p>
                During this semester, I have learned a lot of things. These activities have taught me about what I am and how I can improve myself and become a better person. 
                I have learned that my ideal self is to be someone who knows how to socialize with other people while at the same time staying at my comfort zone, and someone who is smart enough to make better decisions in life. 
                But I learned that my actual self is someone who is mostly quiet, and does not socialize with people most often. I'm not good with decisions and I make a lot of mistakes in my life. 
                But that's exactly why I need to start improving myself so that I can become a better person. And this subject is what I need in order to become my ideal self. In this blog, I will be presenting all of the activities that we went through during the entire semester, 
                and I will explain what I have learned and how I have applied my learnings to myself to become my ideal self.

            <p>For our first activity, we were given a link to a personality test website that lets us know what sort of person we are 
                by simply answering a few questions. After I finished doing the test, the results said that I am an advocate INFJ-T, which stands 
                for introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging, and turbulent. From this activity, I learned what kind of person I am and learned 
                a lot of things about me that I never knew.

                In this activity, we were tasked to create a variety show with at least 3 activities. During this activity, 
                I learned the importance of cooperation when it comes to group activities. Since I am not really great at 
                leading a group I still have a lot to learn about group activities, but the good thing is that there were 
                only a few flaws and everything else went well. I also learned that you should not be afraid to show your 
                hidden talents like singing when required to do so. The important thing is to have fun while performing an 
                activity.

            <p>
                This was when we were tasked to create an 8-segment-wheel that describes ourselves 
                physically, emotionally, interactively, sensually, intellectually, nutritionally, spiritually, and environmentally. 
                The wheel also has 3 layers. The outermost layer is for what your friends think of you, the second inner layer is for what 
                your parents or close relatives think of you, and the innermost layer is for what you think of yourself. During this activity, 
                I have learned that a lot of people see you differently than what you think you are, and only you can understand who you truly are.

               In this activity, we were tasked to create a recap of our personal lives. The story needed to be at least 3 pagges, 
               but min reached 8. During this activity, I learned about what my life was like back then and how I slowly improved to 
               become the person that I am today.
