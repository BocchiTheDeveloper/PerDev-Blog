                Module 1 Reflection
                <br>
                The activities introduced to us during this module were the MBTI Results or Personality Tests, The variety show, and the MMK Story. During this, I learned what sort of person I am just by answering a few questions from a test, which also helped me understand what I am like, what I think and feel and understood myself a little more. I also learned to think about different types of activities for the variety show with my members and make the most out of the 5 minute time limit given to us. Lastly, I also learned what I was like back then and how I slowly improved by partaking in the MMK Story. I realized just how much I changed from who I was back then and learned even more things that I did back then while I was writing my story. Overall, These activities helped me learned a lot of things mostly about myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                Module 2 Reflection
                <br>
                The activities for this module were the 8 segment wheel, the success story roleplay, recipe for success and the power triad. I learned from these activities what the aspects of myself are in terms of emotional, physical, sensual, contextual, nutritional, intellectual, spiritual, and interactional. It made me realize that other people have different views on you and that only you can truly understand who you really are. I also learned how Many Pacquiao became successful today because of his hardwork and perseverance, which inspired others like me to also work hard for a better future. From the recipe for success, I learned all of the required "ingredients" in order to make your life truly successful. And lastly from the power triad I learned what the two wolves inside of me are like and what I must do in order to control them. This module made me learn everything I needed to know about success and the control of one's emotions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Module 3 Reflection
                <br>
                The activities from this module were the developmental stage timeline and the reflections about the activity. I learned from this module how I grew up and changed both physically and emotionally. I also learned the different stages in a person's life and what he or she is able to learn throughout those stages. By reviewing my own timeline, I learned that no one can stay young forever and that we must all learn to grow up and mature as it is part of our personal development as human beings. We may not be able to go back to our younger days, but we are reminded that we are able to look back at how much we changed through our old photos.

            <p>For our first activity, we were given a link to a personality test website that lets us know what sort of person we are 
                by simply answering a few questions. After I finished doing the test, the results said that I am an advocate INFJ-T, which stands 
                for introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging, and turbulent. From this activity, I learned what kind of person I am and learned 
                a lot of things about me that I never knew.

                In this activity, we were tasked to create a variety show with at least 3 activities. During this activity, 
                I learned the importance of cooperation when it comes to group activities. Since I am not really great at 
                leading a group I still have a lot to learn about group activities, but the good thing is that there were 
                only a few flaws and everything else went well. I also learned that you should not be afraid to show your 
                hidden talents like singing when required to do so. The important thing is to have fun while performing an 
                activity.

                This was when we were tasked to create an 8-segment-wheel that describes ourselves 
                physically, emotionally, interactively, sensually, intellectually, nutritionally, spiritually, and environmentally. 
                The wheel also has 3 layers. The outermost layer is for what your friends think of you, the second inner layer is for what 
                your parents or close relatives think of you, and the innermost layer is for what you think of yourself. During this activity, 
                I have learned that a lot of people see you differently than what you think you are, and only you can understand who you truly are.

               but min reached 8. During this activity, I learned about what my life was like back then and how I slowly improved to 
               become the person that I am today.

            <h2>What are the Ingredients for Success?</h2>
            <div class="text-background">
            <p>
                In order to achieve your dreams and to have a successful life, you must have the following ingredients:
                <br>
                1. Hard work, because nothing in life will ever be easy. There will be many challenges ahead which is why you must do your best and work hard to overcome them.
                <br>
                2. Optimism, because although the problems you face will be tough, you can't always have a sad face while trying to overcome them. Overcome your problems with a smile to reassure yourself and others around you that everything will be okay in the end.
                <br>
                3. Learning for mistakes. How else would you pickimprove if you don't learn from mistakes? in life, mistakes are very common. But what you should do is learn from them instead of letting them get to you.
                <br>
                4. Never giving up. Loss is normal, but what we should do about them is to keep getting back up. There's no limit to how much you can try again, that's why if you keep losing, try and try again until you reach your dreams.
                <br>
                5. Become a better person. Make good decisions, learn to love yourself and others, and most importantly, trust in God for He has plans for you, plans that are more than you can imagine. Trust in his plans, ask for his guidance and continue living your life and become a better person.

               In this activity, we were tasked to perform the life of Manny Pacquiao and make a roleplay of it. From this activity, I learned how many people have become successful in their life through hardwork and perseverance. And I also had a lot of fun doing this roleplay with my group members.

                This was when we were tasked to create a collage about our metamorphosis in life. It included our early childhood, elementary years, teenage years and present photos. This activity has made me realize how much I changed both physically and mentally as I lived my life.

        <h1>Portfolio Output No. 5: My Personal Timeline with Reflection</h1>

            <div class="text-background">
            <p>
                1. Is there a 'center' or a central theme in your timeline and life? If you will give a title for your timeline what would it be and why?
                <br>
                The central theme in my life is perseverance. All I dream about in my life is achieving my goals of becoming successful and repaying my parents for their hardwork and sacrifices. If I would give this central theme a title, it would be "I'll make it all come true". The reason why I would choose this title is because it explains my life a lot and it's also the title of a song about pursuing dreams which I really like.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Identify the turning points in your life. What are the thoughts, feelings and actions that you experienced?
                <br>
                The thoughts I experienced are my ideas from overthinking. I keep doubting myself and my own skills which causes me to overthink a lot. The feelings I experienced were complex emotions such as depression, which was during my depressed phase where I had lost interest in everything and didn't have a goal in my life. The actions that I experienced are making better decisions which have led me to where I am today.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Who are/were the most significant people in your life? How did they influence you?
                <br>
                The most significant people in my life are my father and mother. Despite everything, they were the ones who truly supported me and raised me to become a good person. And all I want in my life is to do everything I can to repay them for all of their hardwork and sacrifices.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. What would you change/add if you could? How would each of these changes or additions affect your life, or even change its present course?
                <br>
                What I would change about me is to stop my habit of procrastinating. I often procrastinate when I need to do productive things which causes a lot of problems and stress in my life. I want to improve my time management and be more productive since time is valuable in life.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Where do you want to be in 5 years, and 10 years? What do you expect your future timeline will be?
                <br>
                In 5 years, I want to be able to graduate college and get a job that will help me support my parents while also being a fun job that I like such as programming. In 10 years, I want to live a happy and peaceful life and perhaps start a family if I ever get the chance. I expect my future timeline to be a very peaceful and happy one.

            <div class="text-background">
            <p>
                1. How aware are you of the two different opposing "wolves" operating within your mind, one of which leads to pain and a diminished sense of life and the other to a joyous, meaningful, and fulfilling life?
                <br>
                I am aware of both of these wolves because of how I feel. I know that whenever I am having positive thoughts it is the white wolf that is controlling me while the black one controls me whenever I am having negative thoughts.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. When was the time you feel disappointed by the choice of behavior because you knew that there was a more positive option but you just didn't choose it?
                <br>
                What I am disappointed on is whenever I have to do productive things and yet I choose to procrastinate them. It makes me regret that I wasted time and makes me understand that I should have used my time more wisely.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. What ways or techniques or exercises do you use to strengthen yourself so as to increase its potency to choose and hence control your life?
                <br>
                The exercises I do to control my life is pray and ask God for his guidance, because only through him am I able to cleanse my mind from all negativity and become a better person.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. In what specific ways do you feed the negative wolf?
                <br>
                I feed the negative wolf by letting my emotions take control over me and cause tantrums instead of being calm and finding better solutions to stressful situations.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. In what specific ways do you use to feed the positive wolf?
                <br>
                I feed the positive wolf by making better decisions, knowing how to be calm in certain situations and controlling my emotions. That way, I won't be able to affect others around me and become a better person.

                <br>
                The activities for this module were the 8 segment wheel, the success story roleplay, recipe for success and the power triad. I learned from these activities what the aspects of myself are in terms of emotional, physical, sensual, contextual, nutritional, intellectual, spiritual, and interactional. It made me realize that other people have different views on you and that only you can truly understand who you really are.

This module made me learn everything I needed to know about success and the control of one's emotions.

                Module 3 Reflection
                <br>
                The activities from this module were the developmental stage timeline and the reflections about the activity. I learned from this module how I grew up and changed both physically and emotionally. I also learned the different stages in a person's life and what he or she is able to learn throughout those stages. By reviewing my own timeline, I learned that no one can stay young forever and that we must all learn to grow up and mature as it is part of our personal development as human beings. We may not be able to go back to our younger days, but we are reminded that we are able to look back at how much we changed through our old photos.

            <p>For our first activity, we were given a link to a personality test website that lets us know what sort of person we are 
                by simply answering a few questions. After I finished doing the test, the results said that I am an advocate INFJ-T, which stands 
                for introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging, and turbulent. From this activity, I learned what kind of person I am and learned 
                a lot of things about me that I never knew.

                In this activity, we were tasked to create a variety show with at least 3 activities. During this activity, 
                I learned the importance of cooperation when it comes to group activities. Since I am not really great at 
                leading a group I still have a lot to learn about group activities, but the good thing is that there were 
                only a few flaws and everything else went well. I also learned that you should not be afraid to show your 
                hidden talents like singing when required to do so. The important thing is to have fun while performing an 
                activity.

                This was when we were tasked to create an 8-segment-wheel that describes ourselves 
                physically, emotionally, interactively, sensually, intellectually, nutritionally, spiritually, and environmentally. 
                The wheel also has 3 layers. The outermost layer is for what your friends think of you, the second inner layer is for what 
                your parents or close relatives think of you, and the innermost layer is for what you think of yourself. During this activity, 
                I have learned that a lot of people see you differently than what you think you are, and only you can understand who you truly are.

               but min reached 8. During this activity, I learned about what my life was like back then and how I slowly improved to 
               become the person that I am today.

            <h2>What are the Ingredients for Success?</h2>
            <div class="text-background">
            <p>
                In order to achieve your dreams and to have a successful life, you must have the following ingredients:
                <br>
                1. Hard work, because nothing in life will ever be easy. There will be many challenges ahead which is why you must do your best and work hard to overcome them.
                <br>
                2. Optimism, because although the problems you face will be tough, you can't always have a sad face while trying to overcome them. Overcome your problems with a smile to reassure yourself and others around you that everything will be okay in the end.
                <br>
                3. Learning for mistakes. How else would you pickimprove if you don't learn from mistakes? in life, mistakes are very common. But what you should do is learn from them instead of letting them get to you.
                <br>
                4. Never giving up. Loss is normal, but what we should do about them is to keep getting back up. There's no limit to how much you can try again, that's why if you keep losing, try and try again until you reach your dreams.
                <br>
                5. Become a better person. Make good decisions, learn to love yourself and others, and most importantly, trust in God for He has plans for you, plans that are more than you can imagine. Trust in his plans, ask for his guidance and continue living your life and become a better person.

               In this activity, we were tasked to perform the life of Manny Pacquiao and make a roleplay of it. From this activity, I learned how many people have become successful in their life through hardwork and perseverance. And I also had a lot of fun doing this roleplay with my group members.

                This was when we were tasked to create a collage about our metamorphosis in life. It included our early childhood, elementary years, teenage years and present photos. This activity has made me realize how much I changed both physically and mentally as I lived my life.

            <p>
                1. Is there a 'center' or a central theme in your timeline and life? If you will give a title for your timeline what would it be and why?
                <br>
                The central theme in my life is perseverance. All I dream about in my life is achieving my goals of becoming successful and repaying my parents for their hardwork and sacrifices. If I would give this central theme a title, it would be "I'll make it all come true". The reason why I would choose this title is because it explains my life a lot and it's also the title of a song about pursuing dreams which I really like.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Identify the turning points in your life. What are the thoughts, feelings and actions that you experienced?
                <br>
                The thoughts I experienced are my ideas from overthinking. I keep doubting myself and my own skills which causes me to overthink a lot. The feelings I experienced were complex emotions such as depression, which was during my depressed phase where I had lost interest in everything and didn't have a goal in my life. The actions that I experienced are making better decisions which have led me to where I am today.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Who are/were the most significant people in your life? How did they influence you?
                <br>
                The most significant people in my life are my father and mother. Despite everything, they were the ones who truly supported me and raised me to become a good person. And all I want in my life is to do everything I can to repay them for all of their hardwork and sacrifices.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. What would you change/add if you could? How would each of these changes or additions affect your life, or even change its present course?
                <br>
                What I would change about me is to stop my habit of procrastinating. I often procrastinate when I need to do productive things which causes a lot of problems and stress in my life. I want to improve my time management and be more productive since time is valuable in life.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Where do you want to be in 5 years, and 10 years? What do you expect your future timeline will be?
                <br>
                In 5 years, I want to be able to graduate college and get a job that will help me support my parents while also being a fun job that I like such as programming. In 10 years, I want to live a happy and peaceful life and perhaps start a family if I ever get the chance. I expect my future timeline to be a very peaceful and happy one.

            <div class="text-background">
            <p>
                1. How aware are you of the two different opposing "wolves" operating within your mind, one of which leads to pain and a diminished sense of life and the other to a joyous, meaningful, and fulfilling life?
                <br>
                I am aware of both of these wolves because of how I feel. I know that whenever I am having positive thoughts it is the white wolf that is controlling me while the black one controls me whenever I am having negative thoughts.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. When was the time you feel disappointed by the choice of behavior because you knew that there was a more positive option but you just didn't choose it?
                <br>
                What I am disappointed on is whenever I have to do productive things and yet I choose to procrastinate them. It makes me regret that I wasted time and makes me understand that I should have used my time more wisely.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. What ways or techniques or exercises do you use to strengthen yourself so as to increase its potency to choose and hence control your life?
                <br>
                The exercises I do to control my life is pray and ask God for his guidance, because only through him am I able to cleanse my mind from all negativity and become a better person.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. In what specific ways do you feed the negative wolf?
                <br>
                I feed the negative wolf by letting my emotions take control over me and cause tantrums instead of being calm and finding better solutions to stressful situations.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. In what specific ways do you use to feed the positive wolf?
                <br>
                I feed the positive wolf by making better decisions, knowing how to be calm in certain situations and controlling my emotions. That way, I won't be able to affect others around me and become a better person.
